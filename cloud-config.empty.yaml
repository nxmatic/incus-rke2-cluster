  # EMPTY (NO-OP) CONFIGURATION - FOR PEER NODES
  # =============================================================================

  # This file is intentionally left blank. It serves as a no-op placeholder
  # for peer nodes that do not require any additional configuration beyond
  # what is provided in the base profile. This ensures that the Makefile
  # logic remains consistent and avoids errors when generating cloud-init
  # user data for peer nodes.
