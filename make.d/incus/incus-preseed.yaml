# incus preseed for rke2 cluster (LAN macvlan + cluster bridge) (@codebase)
#
# Architecture:
# - lan0: macvlan device on vmlan0 for PRIMARY internet access via home router
# - wan0: Incus-managed bridge network for inter-node cluster communication ONLY
#
# NOTE: Network naming is historical - "wan" no longer provides internet (see migration plan in docs)
#
# Current routing strategy (November 2025):
# - Internet: via lan0 (metric 100) → home router → reliable NAT
# - Cluster: via wan0 (metric 9999) → Lima VM bridge → node-to-node communication
# - Lima VM NAT disabled due to TCP reliability issues (ICMP works, TCP timeouts)
#
# Previous approach used dual macvlan for both interfaces, which prevented Lima VM from being
# reachable as a gateway due to macvlan isolation (parent cannot communicate with children).
#
# Migration Plan:
# - Rename "wan" network to "vmnet" (VM network for cluster nodes)
# - Rename "wan0" interface to "vmnet0" (requires cluster recreation)
# - See docs/network-architecture.adoc for details
