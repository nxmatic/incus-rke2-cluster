== System Packages Index

The `kpt/system` tree holds shared controller packages that bootstrap or operate the management plane. Each subdirectory contains its own README with usage details. Quick links:

* link:porch/README.adoc[Porch Controllers]
* link:porch-resources/README.adoc[Porch Resources]
* link:replicator/README.adoc[Mittwald Kubernetes Replicator]
* link:flux-operator/README.adoc[Flux Operator]
* link:tekton-pipelines/README.adoc[Tekton Pipelines]
* link:traefik-config/README.adoc[Traefik HelmChartConfig]
* link:cilium-config/README.adoc[Cilium HelmChartConfig]

Each package is mirrored onto the control-plane host via `rke2-kpt-package-sync` and applied during bootstrap using `rke2-kpt-deploy`.
