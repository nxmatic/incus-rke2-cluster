== Bioskop Package Variants

This directory captures everything needed to compose Bioskop’s
downstream manifests:

* `+Kptfile+` + `+bioskop-setters.yaml+` contain shared values that flow
into every cloned catalog package.
* `+packages.yaml+` lists the catalog packages that must be mirrored
into the downstream repo (see comments for what each component
provides).
* `+DEPLOYMENT-ORDER.adoc+` defines the order in which the rendered
packages should be applied on the cluster.

After running `+kpt pkg get+` for each entry in `+packages.yaml+`, the
downstream repo will have
`+packagevariants/bioskop/cluster/<category>/<package>+` directories
ready for `+kpt fn render+`.
See link:DEPLOYMENT-ORDER.adoc[`DEPLOYMENT-ORDER.adoc`] for the recommended reconcile sequence.
