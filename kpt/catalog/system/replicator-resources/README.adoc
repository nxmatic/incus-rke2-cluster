== Replicator Resources kpt Package

This package defines cluster-scoped Kubernetes resources that live in
`kube-system` and are fanned out to workload namespaces via the mittwald
kubernetes-replicator controller. It currently provisions the following
secrets:

* `ghcr-pull` – dockerconfigjson used by Porch / Tekton pullers
* `github-token` – PAT for Porch catalog repositories

=== Usage

[arabic]
. Override `setters.yaml` if you need to change the replication target namespaces
  or the GitHub username (defaults to `x-access-token`).
. Run `kpt fn render` to keep the generated `kustomization.yaml` up to date.
. Commit the resulting, SOPS-encrypted manifests so Flux (with SOPS support)
  can decrypt and apply them. The replicator controller will propagate the
  secrets into every namespace listed in the
  `replicator.v1.mittwald.de/replicate-to` annotation.
