# MANDATORY SEPARATION: Modern cloud-init requires network configuration to be separated
# from user-data to prevent parsing issues. Older cloud-init versions failed silently
# when network config was embedded, causing truncated interface configuration.
#
# Use networkd renderer for systemd-networkd management (shows as "managed" in networkctl).
# Disable IPv6 on lan0 to avoid DHCPv6 client dependency issues that break ifupdown parsing.
